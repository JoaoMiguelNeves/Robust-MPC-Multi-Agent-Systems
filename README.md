# Robust-MPC-Multi-Agent-Systems

This is the code base for the Thesis "A Comparison Study of MPC and Control Barrier Functions
Algorithms for Multi-Agent Systems in the presence of
Obstacles".

This thesis serves as a comparison between LQR (Linear Quadratic Regulator), Control Lyapunov Function and Control Barrier Functions, and MPC (Model Predictive Control) methods of formation control.

Videos of the results as well as the resulting formation measurements can be found under main/stats.
